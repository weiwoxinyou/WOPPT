# WOPPT
A Windows based pipeline managment software

This is a simple software program written by Python. 
PyQt5 framework is used for the UI design and add some simple functions to smooth the experience when using this program.

The entrance file to this program is WoPPT.py by which you can get a simple sofwware to manage your pipelines.
The Layout.UI is designed by Qt Designer to finish a basic layout.

A release of this program named WoPPT.rar is created by PyInstaller and unzip this file you can find a file named WoPPT.exe, by which you can lanuch this software instead of intalling many other softwares or dependecies. 

It is a pitty that I have no more time to finish this program, but I think it's a good program to start learning PyQt5 for those interested in it.
